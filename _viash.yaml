summary: Predicting the profiles of one modality (e.g. protein abundance) from another (e.g. mRNA expression).
description: |
  Experimental techniques to measure multiple modalities within the same single cell are increasingly becoming available. 
  The demand for these measurements is driven by the promise to provide a deeper insight into the state of a cell. 
  Yet, the modalities are also intrinsically linked. We know that DNA must be accessible (ATAC data) to produce mRNA 
  (expression data), and mRNA in turn is used as a template to produce protein (protein abundance). These processes 
  are regulated often by the same molecules that they produce: for example, a protein may bind DNA to prevent the production 
  of more mRNA. Understanding these regulatory processes would be transformative for synthetic biology and drug target discovery. 
  Any method that can predict a modality from another must have accounted for these regulatory processes, but the demand for 
  multi-modal data shows that this is not trivial.

  Explain the motivation behind your proposed task. Describe the biological or computational 
  problem you aim to address and why it's important. Discuss the current state of research in
  this area and any gaps or challenges that your task could help address. This section 
  should convince readers of the significance and relevance of your task.
