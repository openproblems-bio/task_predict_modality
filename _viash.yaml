summary: Predicting the profiles of one modality (e.g. protein abundance) from another (e.g. mRNA expression).
description: |
  Experimental techniques to measure multiple modalities within the same single cell are increasingly becoming available. 
  The demand for these measurements is driven by the promise to provide a deeper insight into the state of a cell. 
  Yet, the modalities are also intrinsically linked. We know that DNA must be accessible (ATAC data) to produce mRNA 
  (expression data), and mRNA in turn is used as a template to produce protein (protein abundance). These processes 
  are regulated often by the same molecules that they produce: for example, a protein may bind DNA to prevent the production 
  of more mRNA. Understanding these regulatory processes would be transformative for synthetic biology and drug target discovery. 
  Any method that can predict a modality from another must have accounted for these regulatory processes, but the demand for 
  multi-modal data shows that this is not trivial.
