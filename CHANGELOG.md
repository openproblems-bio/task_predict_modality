# task_predict_modality 0.2.0

## MINOR CHANGES

* `comp_method`: Run `check_config.py` as part of the component tests, so method metadata is validated like control methods and metrics already are (PR #37).

* `knnr_py`, `knnr_r`, `lm`, `guanlab_dengkw_pm`: Move `documentation_url` and `repository_url` out of `info` and into the top-level `links` (PR #37).

* `novel`, `simple_mlp`: Give the orchestrating workflow components a Nextflow resource label, which `check_config` requires (PR #37).

# task_predict_modality 0.1.1

## MINOR CHANGES

* Bump image version for `openproblems/base_*` images to 1 -- a sliding release (PR #9).

* Bump Viash version to 0.9.4 (PR #12).
