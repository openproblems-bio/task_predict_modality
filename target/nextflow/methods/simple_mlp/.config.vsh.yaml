  description: "Experimental techniques to measure multiple modalities within the\
    \ same single cell are increasingly becoming available. \nThe demand for these\
    \ measurements is driven by the promise to provide a deeper insight into the state\
    \ of a cell. \nYet, the modalities are also intrinsically linked. We know that\
    \ DNA must be accessible (ATAC data) to produce mRNA \n(expression data), and\
    \ mRNA in turn is used as a template to produce protein (protein abundance). These\
    \ processes \nare regulated often by the same molecules that they produce: for\
    \ example, a protein may bind DNA to prevent the production \nof more mRNA. Understanding\
    \ these regulatory processes would be transformative for synthetic biology and\
    \ drug target discovery. \nAny method that can predict a modality from another\
    \ must have accounted for these regulatory processes, but the demand for \nmulti-modal\
    \ data shows that this is not trivial.\n"
